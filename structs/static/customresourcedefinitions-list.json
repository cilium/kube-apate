The IPs that result from DNS resolution of `ToFQDN.MatchName`s are added to the same EgressRule object as ToCIDRSet entries, and behave accordingly. Any L4 and L7 rules within this EgressRule will also apply to these IPs. The DNS -\u003e IP mapping is re-resolved periodically from within the cilium-agent, and the IPs in the DNS response are effected in the policy for selected pods as-is (i.e. the list of IPs is not modified in any way). Note: An explicit rule to allow for DNS traffic is needed for the pods, as ToFQDN counts as an egress rule and will enforce egress policy when PolicyEnforcment=default. Note: If the resolved IPs are IPs within the kubernetes cluster, the ToFQDN rule will not apply to that IP. Note: ToFQDN cannot occur in the same policy as other To* rules. \n The current implementation has a number of limitations: - The DNS resolution originates from cilium-agent, and not from the pods. Differences between the responses seen by cilium agent and a particular pod will whitelist the incorrect IP. - DNS TTLs are ignored, and cilium-agent will repoll on a short interval (5 seconds). Each change to the DNS data will trigger a policy regeneration. This may result in delayed updates to the policy for an endpoint when the data changes often or the system is under load.",

The IPs that result from DNS resolution of `ToFQDN.MatchName`s are added to the same EgressRule object as ToCIDRSet entries, and behave accordingly. Any L4 and L7 rules within this EgressRule will also apply to these IPs. The DNS -\u003e IP mapping is re-resolved periodically from within the cilium-agent, and the IPs in the DNS response are effected in the policy for selected pods as-is (i.e. the list of IPs is not modified in any way). Note: An explicit rule to allow for DNS traffic is needed for the pods, as ToFQDN counts as an egress rule and will enforce egress policy when PolicyEnforcment=default. Note: If the resolved IPs are IPs within the kubernetes cluster, the ToFQDN rule will not apply to that IP. Note: ToFQDN cannot occur in the same policy as other To* rules. \n The current implementation has a number of limitations: - The DNS resolution originates from cilium-agent, and not from the pods. Differences between the responses seen by cilium agent and a particular pod will whitelist the incorrect IP. - DNS TTLs are ignored, and cilium-agent will repoll on a short interval (5 seconds). Each change to the DNS data will trigger a policy regeneration. This may result in delayed updates to the policy for an endpoint when the data changes often or the system is under load.",

The name of the CRD is the numeric identity and the labels on the CRD object are the the kubernetes sourced labels seen by cilium. This is currently the only label source possible when running under kubernetes. Non-kubernetes labels are filtered but all labels, from all sources, are places in the SecurityLabels field. These also include the source and are used to define the identity. The labels under metav1.ObjectMeta can be used when searching for CiliumIdentity instances that include particular labels. This can be done with invocations such as:   kubectl get ciliumid -l 'foo=bar' Each node using a ciliumidentity updates the status field with it's name and a timestamp when it first allocates or uses an identity, and periodically after that. It deletes its entry when no longer using this identity. cilium-operator uses the list of nodes in status to reference count users of this identity, and to expire stale usage.",

The IPs that result from DNS resolution of `ToFQDN.MatchName`s are added to the same EgressRule object as ToCIDRSet entries, and behave accordingly. Any L4 and L7 rules within this EgressRule will also apply to these IPs. The DNS -\u003e IP mapping is re-resolved periodically from within the cilium-agent, and the IPs in the DNS response are effected in the policy for selected pods as-is (i.e. the list of IPs is not modified in any way). Note: An explicit rule to allow for DNS traffic is needed for the pods, as ToFQDN counts as an egress rule and will enforce egress policy when PolicyEnforcment=default. Note: If the resolved IPs are IPs within the kubernetes cluster, the ToFQDN rule will not apply to that IP. Note: ToFQDN cannot occur in the same policy as other To* rules. \n The current implementation has a number of limitations: - The DNS resolution originates from cilium-agent, and not from the pods. Differences between the responses seen by cilium agent and a particular pod will whitelist the incorrect IP. - DNS TTLs are ignored, and cilium-agent will repoll on a short interval (5 seconds). Each change to the DNS data will trigger a policy regeneration. This may result in delayed updates to the policy for an endpoint when the data changes often or the system is under load.",

Only connections which do *not* originate from the cluster or from the local host are subject to CIDR rules. In order to allow in-cluster connectivity, use the FromEndpoints field.  This will match on the source IP address of incoming connections. Adding  a prefix into FromCIDR or into FromCIDRSet with no ExcludeCIDRs is  equivalent.  Overlaps are allowed between FromCIDR and FromCIDRSet. \n Example: Any endpoint with the label \"app=my-legacy-pet\" is allowed to receive connections from 10.3.9.1",

The IPs that result from DNS resolution of `ToFQDN.MatchName`s are added to the same EgressRule object as ToCIDRSet entries, and behave accordingly. Any L4 and L7 rules within this EgressRule will also apply to these IPs. The DNS -\u003e IP mapping is re-resolved periodically from within the cilium-agent, and the IPs in the DNS response are effected in the policy for selected pods as-is (i.e. the list of IPs is not modified in any way). Note: An explicit rule to allow for DNS traffic is needed for the pods, as ToFQDN counts as an egress rule and will enforce egress policy when PolicyEnforcment=default. Note: If the resolved IPs are IPs within the kubernetes cluster, the ToFQDN rule will not apply to that IP. Note: ToFQDN cannot occur in the same policy as other To* rules. \n The current implementation has a number of limitations: - The DNS resolution originates from cilium-agent, and not from the pods. Differences between the responses seen by cilium agent and a particular pod will whitelist the incorrect IP. - DNS TTLs are ignored, and cilium-agent will repoll on a short interval (5 seconds). Each change to the DNS data will trigger a policy regeneration. This may result in delayed updates to the policy for an endpoint when the data changes often or the system is under load.",
